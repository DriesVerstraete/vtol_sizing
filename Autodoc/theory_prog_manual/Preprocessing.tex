\section{Preprocessing}
This section deals with the operations that can be executed outside trim convergence loops, with the aim of boosting efficiency and improving code clarity. Preprocessing deals with the assignment of time shape functions for resolution of the rotor modes, generation of blade mode shapes and setting up the trim problem.
